## Setup:
* [Enable the skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08HSQSYLX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=rich%27s+record+of+the+day), then say *"Alexa, open Rich's Record of the Day"*.

## Other Utterances:
* Saying *"Help"*, *"What does this do?"*, *"How does this work?"*, etc will give you a brief explanation of what the skill does.

## In Future Versions:
* Add functionality to play the record once the user has asked for it, without having to invoke the Spotify/Amazon Music skill separately.
